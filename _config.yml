about-author: > # add description
  I am passionate about making data accessible to all through intelligent data architecture and engineering, but it is of little interest to do so unless I can also free the capacity of analysts and data scientists by automating the generation and implementation of business insights.
  My Goal: Become a Data Scientist who is capable of understanding and executing not just the data analytics and model development, but also the model deployment and integration with the business application.
