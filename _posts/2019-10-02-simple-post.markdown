This will show a simple H2 header, inserting an image into the post using the site.baseurl, resizing that image, and how to place a block quote section.

The following will be a quote from Calvin Coolidge.

>“Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan Press On! has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.”
― Calvin Coolidge
